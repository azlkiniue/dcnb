## Purpose
- Go utility to delete Docker containers that have autogenerated moby-style names (e.g., `inspiring_franklin`).
- Uses the official Docker Go SDK and the moby names list for determining which containers are autogenerated.

## Canonical references
- Project intent: [README.md](../README.md)
- Names list source: https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/internal/namesgenerator/names-generator.go
- Module path and Go version: [go.mod](../go.mod)

## Expected behaviors
- Identify containers whose names match the moby names generator format (`<adjective>_<surname>` from the list) and remove them; leave custom-named containers untouched.
- Use Docker SDK APIs (not shelling out to `docker` CLI) to list and remove containers.
- Provide unit tests that cover detection logic (matching the names list) and container removal calls (mock Docker client).

## Development workflow
- Keep layout simple: `main.go` at repo root plus a couple small helpers (e.g., `names.go`, `docker_client.go`), avoid deep package trees.
- Install deps and tidy: `go mod tidy`.
- Build locally: `go build ./...` (module uses Go 1.25.0).
- Quick cross-compile sanity (multi-arch requirement from README): set `GOOS`/`GOARCH`, e.g., `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build ./...`.
- Tests: `go test ./...`; prefer table-driven cases for name detection.

## Conventions and patterns
- Keep the names list vendored or generated from the upstream file; avoid hardcoding partial subsets.
- Encapsulate Docker client creation behind an interface to allow mocking in tests.
- Treat container delete as idempotent; handle already-removed containers gracefully.

## Open gaps to fill
- There is no source code yet; first add implementation scaffolding and tests.
- Decide whether to sync the names list at build time or vendor a copy; document the choice in README.
