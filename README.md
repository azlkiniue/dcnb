# DCNB 🧹

## Docker Container Name Broom

This Go utility removes Docker containers with autogenerated names (for example, inspiring_franklin or practical_hawking).

### How it works
- Loads adjective/surname lists from moby's names generator and detects names matching `<adjective>_<surname>` with an optional numeric suffix.
- Uses the official Docker Go SDK to list all containers and remove the autogenerated ones.

### Usage
```
go build ./...
./dcnb
```

Cross-compile example:
```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build ./...
```

### Development
- Format and test: `gofmt -w *.go` and `go test ./...`
- Names list: based on [names-generator.go](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/internal/namesgenerator/names-generator.go) from Docker's source code.
